# Flight-Data-Analysis-and-Reporting

✈️ Flight Data Analysis & Reporting using SQL

This project focuses on analyzing flight operations, passenger trends, and airline performance using SQL. The goal is to generate actionable insights that can help airlines, airports, and stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

📊 Project Objectives

Analyze flight delays and cancellations

Examine airline performance across routes

Track passenger traffic trends and peak periods

Identify busiest airports and routes

Provide recommendations for operational efficiency

🗂️ Dataset

The project uses structured flight datasets, typically including:

Flights: flight_id, airline_id, origin, destination, scheduled_departure, actual_departure, status

Airlines: airline_id, airline_name

Airports: airport_id, airport_name, city, country

Passengers: passenger_id, flight_id, age, gender, booking_class, fare

Data sources may include Bureau of Transportation Statistics
 or Kaggle flight datasets.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server) → Data querying, aggregation, and reporting

Power BI / Tableau / Excel (optional) → Visualization of insights

Git & GitHub → Version control and project documentation

📈 Key Analyses

Flight Delays & Cancellations → Avg. delay per airline, route, and airport

Passenger Trends → Passenger counts by month, airline, and route

Revenue Analysis → Average fare, total revenue per flight

Airport Performance → On-time departures/arrivals, busiest airports

Route Analysis → Most frequent routes and high-delay routes


🚀 Key Insights

Airline X had the lowest average delay ✈️

Route Y → Z experienced the highest cancellations ⚠️

Peak passenger traffic occurs in July and December 📈

Some airports handle the highest flight volume, suggesting optimization opportunities

🔮 Future Improvements

Integrate real-time flight data for live reporting

Build interactive dashboards with Power BI or Tableau

Develop predictive models for delay forecasting and passenger demand
